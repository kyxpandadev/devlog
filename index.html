    <h1>Welcome to Kyxpanda's Devlog</h1>
    <p>
        I am a 19 year old living in england working 
        on games in my spare time I have a really interesting project to show you my process
        for making games and hopefully generating a bit of interest in what worlds I create
    </p>

    <h2>What is my current project</h2>
    <p>
        My Current project, The G'old days is a Looter shooter inspired by 
        the likes of Borderlands, Destiny, Warframe. I intend for it to be a single 
        player experience as I do not know how to code multiplayer. If i got a Demo going 
        got the funding for the project to boost it as a multiplayer game I will but that 
        reallly depends on support and my own skills in making a Demo.
