    <h2>Jaid - Generalist</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        I am Jaid a 19 year old living in england working on games in my spare time I have a really interesting project to show you my process
        for making games and hopefully generating a bit of interest in what worlds I create.
    </p>
    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
        I have a lot of experience in games my first exposure to gamedev was back when I was 8 or 9 using scratch in IT class. 
        Then I got a new computer when I turned 11 and the first thing I did was look up how to make games and I was overwhelemed but I downloaded unreal UDK and 
        I dont remember how far I got in a tutorial but im guessing not far. Then after this I found about unity around about 2015 I think. Downloaded it copied 
        from a few tutorials had some ideas for games copied more tutorials and just never got anywhere because I found tutorials 
        are not a good way to learn and retain information (at least for me). So I took a step back for a while learnt some basic programming in c# and then I thought I could make games. 
        Oh how wrong I was. Although I could do more than what I could previously it still was not enough to even attempt to make a small game. I at the time, knew nothing of project managment or anything like that.
        So I took a break still keeping up coding every now and then.<br><br>

        In 2019 I was 15 so in the UK we have college from 16-18 so I was making my application thinking about what I wanted to focus on as a career.
        I said making games. My parents were supportive but hesatant. They are both gamers and know how much I was interested in games, but they didnt really know how strong of a career it would be.<br>
        
        In 2020 the world stopped. I had so much time so I started getting into game development actively again and actually got 
        something going a small project I Don't remember what it was but i got to a point of a demo i never released it but it was there. 
        The code was done but my art skills stopped me from releasing it. So then I spent a few weeks trying blender. 
        I just couldn't get with it with art at all. So again I gave up for a while. <br><br>

        I started College in September 2020, after Covid calmed down a bit. I passed the course gained many skills in 3D and 2D art life was difficult 
        I had my own struggles with Mental Health. But I passed and went to University.<br><br>

        Started uni in september 2022 I Struggled with life the course was really good but life just wasnt Playing nice. 
        So as of writing this I have just left my Game art and design course and im looking to go indy for a bit while working. 
        Now we are in the present. During uni I picked up way more skills and knowledge of the workflow and tools I have so I feel more confident than 
        ever with what I can do.<br><br>
        Thank you for reading my story and I hope you will see more of it as I progress with my projects.
